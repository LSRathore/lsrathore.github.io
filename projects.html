        <h3>Future Agricultural Landscape Transition</h3>
        <p>
            This project investigates how climate change, land-use policies, and socio-economic dynamics
            will shape agricultural landscapes in the coming decades. By integrating geospatial data,
            remote sensing, and machine learning, it identifies likely shifts in cropping patterns and
            evaluates strategies to promote sustainable agriculture.
        </p>

        <h3>Climate-Smart Agriculture</h3>
        <p>
            This project examines how access to processing infrastructure and markets influences crop
            choices and resilience. Using data-driven modeling approaches, it identifies strategies to
            support sustainable farming systems and improve food security under changing climate
            conditions.

        <h3>Irrigation Expansion and Urban Water Scarcity</h3>
        <p>
            Analyzed how rural irrigation expansion impacts urban water scarcity in the United States.
            Using the H08 hydrological model, the study quantified trade-offs between agricultural water
            use and urban water security.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtual Water Trade</h3>
        <p>
            Investigated virtual water transfers between U.S. counties due to trade in cereals and
            milled grains. Assessed the sustainability of these trade flows based on water scarcity
            conditions at the origin of exports.
