            <h3>Future Agricultural Landscape Transition</h3>
            <p>This project explores how climate change, land-use policies, and socio-economic dynamics will shape agricultural landscapes in the coming decades. By integrating geospatial data, remote sensing, and machine learning, it identifies likely shifts in cropping patterns and evaluates strategies to promote sustainable agriculture. The project examines the impacts of crop choices, management practices, and policy interventions on food production and land use.</p>
            <h3>Cliamte Smart Agriculture</h3>
            <p>Investigating how access to processing infrastructure and markets influences crop choices. Using modeling, the project identifies strategies to enhance resilience, support sustainable farming, and improve food security under changing climates.</p>

            <h3>Irrigation Exapansion and Urban Water Scarcity</h3>
            <p>Studied how rural irrigation expansion impacts urban water scarcity in the U.S. Using the H08 hydrological model, the project quantified trade-offs between agricultural water use and urban water security.</p>
            <h3>Virtual Water Trade</h3>
            <p>Looked into the virtual water transder between US counties due to trade of ceareal and milled grains. Assesed the sustainability of the trade based on water scarce origins of export.</p>
