    <div class="philosophy">
      <p>
	I am interested in understanding agricultural and food systems and their connections with water resources, farming practices, 
	governmental policies, growing food demands, regional biodiversity, and rural livelihoods. These connections are complex 
	in real-world systems and are often bidirectional, with human decisions shaping environmental outcomes and environmental 
	constraints influencing human choices.      </p>
      <p>
	Through my research, I generate insights that help assess the environmental 
	implications of agriculture and the long-term sustainability of agri-food systems. 
	As global food demand continues to increase, pressure on food production systems 
	will intensify, and future agri-food systems are unlikely to resemble those of today. Ensuring that these 
	transitions are sustainable requires deliberate 
	and informed decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
	My work aims to identify and evaluate desirable agricultural transitions that are climate-resilient, environmentally 
	sustainable, and supportive of smallholder and farming communities. Methodologically, I use large-scale hydrological models, 
	statistical methods, and machine-learning-based approaches to understand how climatic and anthropogenic drivers 
	influence food and water systems.
	Below is a conceptual overview of my research on agri-food system transitions, human–environment interactions, 
	and sustainable resource use.
